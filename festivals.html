                        <p>The Gameng Festival is a municipal festival in Solsona, Ilocos Norte. One of its components is the Abaludal Dance Parade which showcases one of their primary root crops, the aba or gabi (taro) that can be made into different dishes. The Dance Parade shows the different steps in planting the said product. The said project aims to strengthen the preservation of a highly cultured entity and society which has been the very goal of the previous festivals of the town. It also seeks to elicit awareness among the young generation to understand and be reoriented with the value-laden culture of the past which channels the present and the future.
